# Stable Neo-Hookean Flesh Simulation
[Stable Neo-Hookean](https://graphics.pixar.com/library/StableElasticity/paper.pdf) is a hyperelastic energy that remain stable under large deformations. This is the FEM implementation with Stable Neo-Hookean energy in [libigl](https://libigl.github.io)

## Finite Element Method
 In order to enable the physics simulation, all deformation laws have to be discretized. Tetrahedral meshes are common discrete volumetric geometry representations. All the quantity inside the volume can be represent use a shape function $\phi_i(x)$ where $x \in R^3$ is a position inside the space volume.

## Deformations
In order to determine forces due to deformation, we need to know how the nearby points have moved relative to one another. This information is captured by the **Deformation Gradient** $F$.
## The Strain Energy
$$
\psi(F) = \frac{\mu}{2}(I_C - 3) + \frac{\lambda}{2}(J - 1 - \frac{\mu}{\lambda})^2
$$
where $J=\text{det}(F)$, $I_C = \text{tr}(F^TF)$, $\mu$ and $\lambda$ are Lam√© constants.
